	Set to -1 for no limit.  See also the DBCP documentation on this
	and the minEvictableIdleTimeMillis configuration parameter.

	<!-- maxWait: Maximum time to wait for a dB connection to become available
	in ms, in this example 10 seconds. An Exception is thrown if
	this timeout is exceeded.  Set to -1 to wait indefinitely.

	The autoReconnect=true argument to the url makes sure that the
