##Registration Files
- [registration #1](registration.H2MU-576N-DJ58-W8Q6)
- [registration #2](registration.K6AA-Y33X-C7ZT-K4TF)

NOTE: The files are signed with the current **private_reg_key** and may not work with the pre-compiled binaries.

With these `registration` files, you can play the full game or connect to your **private** Matchmaking service.
<br />
The files must be renamed and distributed to each Match player:
- registration~~.H2MU-576N-DJ58-W8Q6~~
- registration~~.K6AA-Y33X-C7ZT-K4TF~~

The OS specific locations are as follows:
- Windows XP: `C:\Documents and Settings\Username\TribalTrouble\`
- Windows Vista or newer: `C:\Users\Username\TribalTrouble\`
- Mac OS X: `Library/Application Support/TribalTrouble/`
- Linux: `~/.TribalTrouble/`

The following services must be running for Match play:
```
server/matchmaker
server/router
```

The Matchmaking service depends on [DNS](../dns/DNS.md) and [MySQL](../mysql/MYSQL.md)
